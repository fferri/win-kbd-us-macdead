# US Layout with macOS-style dead keys for Windows

The keyboard layout designates several keys as "dead keys", particularly `AltGr+backtick`, `AltGr+e`, `AltGr+u`, `AltGr+i`, `AltGr+n`, similarily to the macOS' US keyboard layout.

# How to build / install

The layout file can be opened with Microsoft's Keyboard Layout Creator (MKLC) tool, which Microsoft distributes for free. After opening the file in MKLC, choosing Project -> Build DLL and Setup Package will create an installer that can be used to add this layout to Windows.

**Remember** to log off and on again, in order for the changes to take effect.
